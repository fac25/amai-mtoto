This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


# Project documentation


## Introduction - Sumithra

### What are you building?
An app for Afro-Carribbean pregnant women to get support for their mental and physical wellbeing.

### Why are you building it?
To fill a gap in the market since there does not currently exist (as far as we know) an app that integrates all the above functionality in one place.


## Project scope - Patrick
### What are you not building?
- We are not building a website tailored to all women
- A platform which provides full health support for our users
- A platform to book appointments with health professionals
    
   

### How did you decide what features were important?
A quantitive approach was used, based on the usability tests we did with our user pool.
We also considered the quantity of users affected by the feature when prioritizing features.

## Project plan - Yassien
### How are you going to structure your sprints?
### What order are you going to build in?
### How did user research inform your plan?

## Requirement analysis - Alex
### How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?

A Chrome extention called WAVE to assit with page accessibility. Also lighthouse tests as well as referencing the A11y checklist. 

### Are there any legal or regulatory requirements you should consider?
We need to consider that not all the advice given will benefit all users. Thus we have chosen to add disclaimers to our article pages. 

## Project learnings

### What would you do differently next time?
## Research and findings 
### What did you find out from user testing?
## Project outcomes 
### Were your assumptions right or wrong?
## Recommendations and conclusions 
### What features would you prioritise to build next?
### Was the project a success?
# Software Development Lifecycle stages 
## Planning 
### What roles did your team take on?
Scrum: Patrick
QA: Yassien
UX/UI: Sumithra
DevOps: Alex
### Explain the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project (K2)

### Did these roles help your team work effectively?
Outline how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately (K6) Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution (K6)

## Analysis 
### What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?
## Design 
### How did you plan a user experience?
We used Figma to develop a prototype based on some sketches and inspiration that we found online. 
### What technical decisions did you make?
### Server-render vs client-render vs both
### Relational or non-relational or no DB
### Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service
### Frontend first vs DB first
### Did you create a technical specification?
### Review methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and apply a justified approach to software development (K11, S11, S12)

## Implementation/Build 
### How did you ensure your code was good?
### Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)

### What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?
### Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)

### How did you debug issues that arose?
### Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)

## Test 
### How did you verify your project worked correctly?
### Identify and create test scenarios which satisfy the project specification (S6)

### Did writing automated tests catch any bugs?
### Analyse unit testing results and review the outcomes, correcting errors. (S4)

## Deploy 
### Where/how did you deploy your application?
We chose to deploy our app on Vercel. 
### Review and justify their contribution to building, managing and deploying code into the relevant environment in accordance with the project specification (S10)

### What problems did you encounter during deployment?
Problems with the build script. 
## Maintain 
### Is it easy for someone make changes to the codebase?
### Could a new person quickly be onboarded to contribute?
